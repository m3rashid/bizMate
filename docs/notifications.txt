WEB UI NOTIFICATIONS

The Push model: The server pushes the notifications to the client via some connection like WebSockets, Long Polling etc. 
It suffers from certain problems like thundering herd where the server is overwhelmed by a hotspot notification and has to send this to a lot of users all at once.
This doesn't scale well

The pull model: The server creates a notification object (maybe saved in a database) and the client makes a call to get any new notifications.
The client can implement a short polling strategy to get the notifications in a near-real time.
In case of hotspot notification, the server is not overloaded because the client ask for it and the server can remain stateless in this regard.

We are using the pull model
1. The client short polls the server at a regular interval to get it's notifications
2. The server returns the notifications as a paginated list
