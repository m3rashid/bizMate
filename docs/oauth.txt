Backend OAUTH Explicit Flow

Server := Our backend server
Provider := Provider's server (google, github etc)

1. Client makes a call to the server to start the auth flow
2. Server Makes a call to the provider's backend
3. User selects the account to be used for OAUTH (from the provider's domain)
4. After selection, the provider generates (IdToken, AccessToken and RefreshToken) among things mentioned in the scope
5. With these data, the provider makes a call to the server's callback url
6. The server does its things with the data (like validation etc.), saves the RefreshToken in its database and return JWT to the Client
7. On Getting the response from the server, the user is authenticated

Frontend OAUTH Explicit Flow

1. Client opens a new window, with the URL of the server (to initiate the process)
2. The client keeps a reference of the original window and adds an event Listener for any message events
3. The domain is changed to the provider's and all things are on the more secure back channel
4. The user selects an account and the server redirects to the client's expected callback url
5. The newly opened window's last url contains the JWT token and other details
6. The client extracts the data from the token and makes a postMessage to the original window
7. The newly opened window is now closed
8. On getting the data, the eventListener runs and sets the JWT token in the browser's localStorage
9. The client then makes a call to the backend to get the user info
10. On getting the user info, the client logs the user in by setting the app's local state
